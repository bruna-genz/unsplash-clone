Unsplash Clone

This is a project from Microverse.

The goal of this project was to clone the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) homepage using the basic [CSS framework](https://github.com/oscardelalanza/Grid-framework) that we created.

This website was built using HTML and CSS.

Project made by [Bruna Genz](https://github.com/bruna-genz) and [Oscar de La Lanza](https://github.com/oscardelalanza).
